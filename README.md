CHIMP (Conflict-driven Hierarchical Meta-CSP Planner)
=====================================================

Summary
-------

CHIMP is a hierarchical hybrid planner It combines HTN-Planning and meta-constraint reasoning and is based on the Meta-CSP Framework. Currently, it supports causal, temporal and resource knowledge as well as knowledge that is provided by an external path planner.

CHIMP aims at enabling a mobile robot to use different forms of knowledge in its planning process. Furthermore, it can produce plans that can be executed in parallel, and additional goal tasks can be inserted into an existing plan during the execution of the plan. For details please see our [paper][iros-paper] at IROS 2015.
