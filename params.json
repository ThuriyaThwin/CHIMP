  "body": "CHIMP is a hierarchical hybrid planner. It combines HTN-Planning and meta-constraint reasoning and is based on the Meta-CSP Framework. Currently, it supports causal, temporal and resource knowledge as well as knowledge that is provided by an external path planner.\r\n\r\nCHIMP aims at enabling a mobile robot to use different forms of knowledge in its planning process. Furthermore, it can produce plans that can be executed in parallel, and additional goal tasks can be inserted into an existing plan during the execution of the plan. For details please see our [paper at IROS 2015][iros-paper].\r\n\r\n[iros-paper]: http://aass.oru.se/~mmi/papers/iros15-chimp.pdf\r\n\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n### Examples ###\r\n\r\nTo test CHIMP you can try different example domains in the package examples/chimp. TestRACEDomain.java uses a domain description from the robot waiter scenario from the [RACE project](http://project-race.eu/). It creates a plan for serving a hot coffee with milk and sugar, i.e., all objects need to be served fast enough so that the coffee will not get cold.\r\n\r\nCHIMP needs a domain and a problem description in order to generate a plan. The domain contains the HTN-methods and operators and the problem contains the initial state of the world and the goal tasks.\r\n\r\nCHIMP uses [gradle](https://gradle.org).\r\nYou can start CHIMP from the command line with `gradle run` followed by arguments for the domain file and the problem file, e.g.:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\ngradle run -Dexec.args=\"domains/ordered_domain.ddl problems/test_m_serve_coffee_problem_1.pdl\"\r\n```\r\n",
